# Welcome to my first project :)
Hey everyone, This is one of my first projects and also one of my first experiences with Github. 

## History
So this project is supposed to replicate the popular word game created in 1953 named Mad-Libs.
It was created by Leonard Stern and Rodger Price after havging struggles with a script.

## Instructions
In this game you'll be prompted to give a Color, Plural Noun, and a name.
After doing that a short poem will be generated, filling in the words you've given into 3 short sentences. 

## Potential Future Changes
As far as how to make this project better, I was thinking about 
* Figuring out how to implement AI
* Cleaning up the code/Making it more efficient.
* Adding a GUI to make my project look more presentable
